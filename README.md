# ðŸŒŠ Living Ocean â€” C++ Simulation

A simple simulation of an oceanic ecosystem written in C++. It models the behavior of algae, herbivorous and predatory fish in a 2D grid. The project uses key concepts of modern C++: OOP, templates, smart pointers, exceptions, RAII, Rule of Five, and Pimpl idiom.

## ðŸ§© Description

The project simulates an ocean environment with the following entities:

- **Sand** â€” an empty cell  
- **Algae** â€” algae that grow and reproduce  
- **HerbivoreFish** â€” herbivorous fish that eat algae  
- **PredatorFish** â€” predatory fish that hunt herbivorous fish  

On each time step (tick), all living organisms update their state:
- Movement  
- Searching for food  
- Reproduction  
- Death from hunger or old age  

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- C++17
- CMake â‰¥ 3.14
- make/g++
- OS: Windows, Linux or macOS
